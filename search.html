                <p>Today's Gorakhnath Math, centred at Gorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh (also named after the saint),
                    is a religious institution that runs two Gorakhnath temples, one in Nepal in the district of Gorkha
                    (another word believed to be derived from Baba Gorakhnath), and the other a little south of
                    Gorakhpur. The temple at Gorakhpur is said to contain the samadhi shrine (transl. tomb) and gaddi
                    (transl. prayer seat) of Gorakhnath. These temples constitute the centre of most of the Hindu
                    religious activity in this region.
                    <p>Gorakhpur takes its name from Gorakhnath, who was a saint and travelled widely across India and authored a number of texts that form a part of the canon of Nath Sampradaya. The Gorakhnath Math is a temple of the Nath monastic group of the Nath tradition. The Nath tradition was founded by guru Matsyendranath. This math is situated in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh within a large premises. The temple performs various cultural and social activities and serves as the cultural hub of the city.
                        A shrine called Gorakhnath Mandir was built in his honour at the location. The musical Light and Sound Show in the evening is the main attraction these days.</p>
